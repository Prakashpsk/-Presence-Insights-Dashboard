   - **Filtered Rows**: Removed irrelevant rows.
   - **Removed Other Columns**: Kept only necessary columns.
   - **Data**: Loaded the cleaned data.
   - **Promoted Headers**: Set the top row as the header.
   - **Removed Top Rows**: Eliminated unnecessary top rows.
   - **Renamed Columns**: Standardized column names.
   - **Unpivoted Other Columns**: Restructured the data for analysis.
   - **Renamed Columns1**: Adjusted column names post-unpivoting.
   - **Changed Type**: Corrected data types for analysis.
   - **Removed Errors**: Ensured data quality by removing errors.
3. 🛠️ **Data Cleaning**: Ensured data consistency and handled missing values.
4. 📊 **Data Visualization**: Created interactive charts and graphs using Power BI.

## 📊 Visualization
The dashboard includes:
- **Present % by Date**: Tracks daily presence percentage.
- **WFH % by Date**: Displays work-from-home trends over time.
- **SL % by Date**: Shows sick leave percentages over time.
- **Day of Week Analysis**: Breaks down presence, WFH, and SL percentages by day of the week.
